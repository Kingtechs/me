  <div class="about-intro">
    <p>
    I have always been the kind of person who is curious about how things work, whether it is technology, ideas, or people. I like figuring things out, taking them apart, understanding the reason behind them, and putting them back together a little better than before.
I am a dad of two amazing kids, a boy and a girl who keep me grounded and motivated. They remind me every day what really matters. Some of my favorite moments are the simple ones like playing together, watching movies, or helping them with their Homework. They are the reason I keep pushing forward and trying to be better, even when life gets tough.
I have always been a mix of calm and energy. I love peace and quiet, but I also enjoy challenges that make you grow and see things in a new way. I am not afraid of mistakes because I think they make life more interesting. Every setback teaches me something new and usually turns into a story worth telling later.
When I am not working on something, I like playing game, watching shows,or late night ideas that somehow turn into projects.
At the end of the day, I am just someone trying to build a good life, one filled with creativity, growth, and purpose. I believe in Having fun, Enjoying what you do, and doing everything with heart.
